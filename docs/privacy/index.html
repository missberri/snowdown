  <h1>Snowdown Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2026</p>

  <p>Snowdown (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Snowdown mobile application and related services (the “App”).</p>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>Snowdown is designed to provide information about events, schedules, and activities. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process personal information.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or account information</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect location data</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> include forms, user accounts, or login features</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> track users across apps or websites</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
  <p>Snowdown does <strong>not</strong> use analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies that collect personal or device-level data.</p>
  <p>Standard, non-identifiable technical information (such as basic web requests required to display content) may be processed by underlying hosting or platform providers, but Snowdown does not access or store this information.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may display content such as maps, images, or links that originate from third-party services. These services operate independently and have their own privacy practices. Snowdown does not control or receive user data from these services.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Snowdown does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because Snowdown does not collect or store personal data, there is no personal information maintained or secured by the App.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted at this location with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the Snowdown App, you may contact us at:</p>
